# club-social

Club Social is a social app for country club members. It helps them connect with management about table reservations, tee-times, or food orders
and with other members of the same club to chitchat or schedule to meet up.

Club Social's goal is to become the digital interface for Country Clubs who have a sub-optimal online presence. Country Clubs can now focus on
serving their user in the ways they know best- like purtchasing state of the art sod, or a salt water filtration system instead of dumping money into
bad apps from shoddy devshops.
